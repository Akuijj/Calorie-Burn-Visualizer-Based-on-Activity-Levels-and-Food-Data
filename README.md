## Description:

This project consists of a C program that visualizes calorie burn across different activity levels based on a dataset of food items. The program reads food data from a text file, calculates the calories burned for each activity level (sedentary to super active), and presents the results as a bar graph. The bar graph is adjusted according to realistic multipliers based on activity intensity.

The food data contains various food items, their caloric content, and macronutrient composition (protein, fat, and carbohydrates). This allows the program to simulate calorie consumption and visualize how different activity levels influence the energy burned after consuming specific foods.

The multipliers are applied to a base burn rate, which is used to calculate and display the amount of calories burned at each level, allowing users to get an intuitive sense of how activity influences their calorie expenditure.

## Features:

Displays calorie burn across five activity levels: sedentary, lightly active, moderately active, very active, and super active.
Bar graphs to visualize the calorie burn rate, scaled for each activity level.
Realistic multipliers for activity levels to reflect more accurate burn rates.
Food data file includes various food items with their nutritional values.
